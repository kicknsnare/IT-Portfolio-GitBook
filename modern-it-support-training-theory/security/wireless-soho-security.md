# Wireless SOHO Security

## Update Firmware and Defaults

* Update the default password and update the firmware from the emulator or the driver&#x20;
* NOTE: Make sure during the firmware update your device will be plugged in and i will not disconnect&#x20;
* Wireless Settings -> Change the default SSID / HIDE SSID -> If you hide the ssid you have to make sure to type the right SSID in order to locate the router

On TP-Link Website you can download the drivers or use the emulators

* Since I have a non-business device I did not find mine with the emulator
