# Desktop Operating Systems



## What is an Operating System

It is what allows us to interact with the hardware

## 32-Bit OS vs 64-Bit OS

* 32 OS has memory limitations up to only 4 GB vs 64 OS doesn't
* You can run a 32-bit on a x64 processor but not the other way arround. Same as if you install a 32-bit on a x64 you will still have memory limitations
