# Workstation Backup And Recovery Method



### Backup Types

* Full -> complete copy of the dataset, don't recommended to do it every single time we are going to perform a backup because it is time consuming and resource consuming.&#x20;
* Incremental -> only backups the data the were modified&#x20;
