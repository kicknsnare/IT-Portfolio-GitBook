1. What is a workgroup network and how does it differ from a domain network?

* My answer: a workgroup network it is private, which means that you need to have acess to the computer and the password to access the account. A domain network takes all the devices and controlls them to make them accesible to whoever has the password
* Research: Workgroup network is a peer-to-peer network where each computer has its own set of user accounts, and there is no centralized control. Domain network, on the other hand, is a client-server network where a central server manages user accounts and permissions.

1. In what types of environments are workgroup networks typically used?

* My answer: NA
* Research: Home networks and small businesses

1. How does a workgroup network handle user authentication and resource access?

* My answer: With passwords
* Research: In a workgroup network, each computer manages its own user authentication locally. Users need to have accounts on each individual computer they want to access.

1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a workgroup network?

* Advantages: Secure because you need first phycally access to the computer and you need the password
* Disadvantages: It can make things slow in fast pace environments
*   Research:&#x20;

    Advantages of a workgroup network:

    1. Simple setup: Easy to set up and manage, suitable for small environments.
    2. Cost-effective: No need for dedicated servers, reducing infrastructure costs.
    3. Decentralized: Each computer operates independently, providing autonomy.

    Disadvantages of a workgroup network:

    1. Limited scalability: Not well-suited for larger environments due to scalability issues.
    2. Lack of centralized control: Difficult to manage user accounts and permissions centrally.
    3. Security challenges: Security measures are applied individually to each computer, making it harder to enforce consistent security policies.

1. How does a domain network differ from a workgroup network in terms of user authentication and resource access?

* Workgroup network you need to access the account from the computer and even if you replicate the username and password you won't have the same resources in other computer. In the other hand a domain network makes possible to access the same account and resources from another computer

1. Can you provide an example of when it might be more appropriate to use a domain network over a workgroup network?

* Businesses, When you have thousends or hundreds of computers to set up, with a lot of employees working

1. How does a domain network support centralized management of resources and user accounts?

* Research:  a domain network provides a centralized and organized approach to managing user accounts, resources, and security settings, offering better control and scalability compared to workgroup networks.

1. What are some best practices for configuring and managing a domain network?

*   Research: &#x20;

    1. **Regular Backups:** Regularly backup critical data and configurations on the domain controller.
    2. **Security Updates:** Apply security updates promptly to all domain systems.
    3. **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies to enhance security.
    4. **Group Policies:** Use Group Policies for consistent security and configuration across the domain.
    5. **Monitor Network Traffic:** Regularly monitor network traffic for anomalies or security breaches.
    6. **Access Controls:** Implement least privilege access principles to limit user permissions.
    7. **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and reviews of user accounts and permissions.
    8. **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation for configurations and changes.
    9. **Redundancy:** Implement redundancy for critical domain components to ensure continuity.
    10. **User Training:** Provide user training on security practices to mitigate human-related risks.
